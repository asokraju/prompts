Below are two professional prompts for generating memmaid charts for your code. Both prompts include a note to eliminate (, ) symbols as memaiad is throwing errors.

**High Level Overview Prompt**

Create a memmaid chart that provides a concise overview of the code architecture. Focus on outlining the major components such as modules, key functions, and the overall flow of logic. Emphasize the interactions and dependencies between components while excluding low level details. The resulting diagram should clearly convey the system structure and core design decisions in a simplified manner. Also eliminate (, ) symbols as memaiad is throwing errors.

**Detailed Overview Prompt**

Create a memmaid chart that comprehensively details the entire code base. Include all modules, functions, classes, and data flows in the diagram. Map out the intricate interactions and dependencies along with error handling, edge cases, and specific algorithms. The diagram should serve as complete visual documentation that covers every critical element and internal workflow. Ensure the chart enhances clarity and assists in understanding the full depth of the implementation. Also eliminate (, ) symbols as memaiad is throwing errors.
